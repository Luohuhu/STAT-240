## Read the Data

```{r read-data}
## read the individual data sets
den = read_airport("../../data/DEN-2018.html")
jfk = read_airport("../../data/JFK-2018.html")
lax = read_airport("../../data/LAX-2018.html")
msp = read_airport("../../data/MSP-2018.html")
ord = read_airport("../../data/ORD-2018.html")
sfo = read_airport("../../data/SFO-2018.html")

## combine into one data set
awt = bind_rows(den, jfk, lax, msp, ord, sfo)

## remove the individual ones
rm(den, jfk, lax, msp, ord, sfo)
```

## Questions

1. Are some airports more efficient that than others in terms of average wait time?  
    - Are some airports more efficient in the number of people served by hour per available booth?

2. Are some months busier than others?  
    - Are some days of the week busier than others?  
    - Are some times during the day busier than others?  

3. How does the proportion of people who get through customs in less than 30 minutes depend on other factors?  

## Airport efficiency

> Are some airports more efficient than others in terms of average wait time?

```{r efficient}
ggplot(awt, aes(x=airport, y=all_avg_wait, color=airport)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

- We can adjust the plot by reordering the airports in descending order by the median of their average waiting time for all passengers.
- Here, I do not save the reordering of the airports
- The modified data set is piped into `ggplot()`

```{r}
awt %>%
  mutate(airport = reorder(airport,-all_avg_wait, FUN=median)) %>% 
  #`airport` as factor with levels ordered according to -all_avg_wait and FUN value
  # reorder actually change the order but arrange only change it in the surface, although arrange prints out in order, but deep down it is still unchanged.
  ggplot(aes(x=airport, y=all_avg_wait, color=airport)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Are some airports more efficient that than others in terms of average wait time?")
```


> Are some airports more efficient in the number of people served by hour per available booth?

- Calculate the average number of people served per hour per booth
- There are a few ways to consider how to calculate this
- Here, we do the calculation separately for each airport and hour during the day
    - We then calculate the total number of passengers and the total number of booths each hour, then divide
- An alternative could be to calculate the rate for row of the data set and then to find the average (or median) of these rates    
### method 1

```{r people-per-hour-per-booth}
awt %>%
  group_by(airport, hour) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(all_total),
            booth_total = sum(all_booths)) %>%
  mutate(per_booth = round(total/booth_total,2)) %>%
  select(-total, -booth_total) %>%
  ggplot(aes(hour, per_booth, color=airport)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=45, linetype="dashed",color="red") +
  facet_wrap(~airport) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ylab("Passengers per booth") +
  ggtitle("Are some airports more efficient", 
          subtitle = "in the number of people served by hour per available booth?")
```

- There do appear to be differences between the efficiency (in terms of passengers per booth per hour) among the airports.
- For example, MSP seems to be more efficient (in the noted sense) regularly serving more than 45 passengers per booth per hour.
- SFO seems to serve fewer than 45 passengers per booth per hour most of the time.

### Second method

```{r people-per-hour-per-booth-2}
awt %>%
  mutate(rate = all_total / all_booths) %>% 
  group_by(airport, hour) %>%
  summarize(rate_mean = mean(rate),
            rate_median = median(rate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = rate_median, color=airport)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 45,
             linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ airport) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ylab("Passengers per booth") +
  ggtitle("Are some airports more efficient", 
          subtitle = "in the number of people served by hour per available booth?")
```


## Busy times

> Are some months busier than others?

- Begin by adding a month variable and then reordering the columns
- Also add weekday for future use

```{r}
awt = awt %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         wday = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  select(airport, terminal, date, month, everything())
```


- Count the total number of passengers by month and sort.

```{r months}
awt %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(all_total)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))
# different days in each month, so it is not very fair
```

- The previous summary is affected by different numbers of days in each month.
- Calculate the average daily rate of passengers by month.
- (Recall that May has only 30 observations.)

- Key idea here is to first summarize by month and day, and then by month,
in order to get the total number of passengers in each month
and the number of days in each month.

```{r busy-months}
busy_months = awt %>%
  mutate(day = day(date)) %>%
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(all_total)) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  # need to group twice
  summarize(n = n(), total = sum(total), daily = total/n) %>%
  arrange(desc(daily))

ggplot(busy_months, aes(x=month, y=daily)) +
  geom_col(fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  # can not use geom_bar() for some reason
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("# Arrivals") +
  ggtitle("Daily International Arrival Totals", subtitle = "at six selected US Airports")
```

- It looks like the summer months (July, August, June) are the busiest in terms of number of passengers traveling per day for the airports in our data.


> Are some days of the week busier than others?  

```{r busy-weekdays}
# We first need to count the number of each day of the week in 2018
busy_wdays = awt %>%
  group_by(date, wday) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(all_total)) %>%
  group_by(wday) %>%
  summarize(n=n(), total = sum(total))  %>%
  mutate(daily=round(total/n,2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(daily)) 
busy_wdays

ggplot(busy_wdays, aes(x = wday, y = daily)) +
  geom_col(fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  xlab("Day of the week") +
  ylab("Average number of passengers") +
  ggtitle("Are some days of the week busier than others?")
```

> Are some times during the day busier than others?  

```{r busy-times}
busy_times = awt %>%
  group_by(date, hour) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(all_total)) %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), total = sum(total))  %>%
  mutate(hourly = round(total/n,2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(hourly)) 
busy_times

ggplot(busy_times, aes(x = hour, y = hourly)) +
  geom_col(fill = "blue", col = "black") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))  +
  xlab("Time of the day") +
  ylab("# of passengers") +
  ggtitle("Average Hourly International Arrivals", subtitle = "at six select US airports")

```

## Getting through customs quickly

> How does the proportion of people who get through customs in less than 30 minutes depend on other factors?  

```{r add-proportions}
## Add columns for proportion less than 30 minutes and proportion more than an hour
awt = awt %>%
  mutate(p_less_30 = (all_n_0_15 + all_n_16_30) / all_total,
         p_more_60 = (all_n_61_90 + all_n_91_120 + all_n_120_plus) / all_total)
```

#### Factor: Airport

```{r less30-airport}
awt %>%
  mutate(airport = reorder(airport,p_less_30,FUN=median)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=airport,y=p_less_30,color=airport)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Proportion of people through customs in < 30 minutes depend on other factors?",
          subtitle = "Factor: airport")
```

#### Factor: Hour

```{r less30-hour}
## Fraction of passengers per hour that go through in < 30 minutes

          n_less_30 = sum(all_n_0_15) + sum(all_n_16_30),
          p_less_30 = n_less_30 / total,
          booths = sum(all_booths)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(hour,p_less_30, size = booths)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Proportion of people through customs in < 30 minutes depend on other factors?",
          subtitle = "Factor: hour")
```



#### Factor: Airport and Hour

```{r less30-airport-hour}
## Fraction of passengers per airport and per hour that go through in < 30 minutes
awt %>%
  group_by(airport,hour) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(all_total),

            p_less_30 = n_less_30 / total,
            booths = sum(all_booths)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% ## airport is a grouping variable and cannot be mutated

  ggtitle("Proportion of people through customs in < 30 minutes depend on other factors?",
          subtitle = "Factor: airport and hour")
```

```{r less30-airport-hour-check}
# It looks like some of the airports do not have passengers in certain time windows
# Is that correct?  
awt %>% 
  filter(airport=="MSP") %>%
  group_by(hour) %>%
  summarize(tot = sum(all_total))
```


```{r less30-airport-hour-2}
## Let's try a scatterplot of the same information as the previous graphic
## -> which is easier to interpret?
