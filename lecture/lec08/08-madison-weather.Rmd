## Temperature Trends over Time

- We will examine trends in average temperature over time.

```{r}
## read in the data
official = read_csv("../../data/madison-weather-official-2020.csv",
                    col_types = cols( name = col_character(),
                                      date = col_date(format = ""),
                                      prcp = col_double(),
                                      snow = col_double(),
                                      snow_depth = col_double(),
                                      tmin = col_double(),
                                      tmax = col_double(),
                                      tavg = col_double()))
```

## Annual average temperature

- Calculate the average temperature per year
    - Select variables
    - Drop missing values
    - Group and summarize
- Plot versus the year
- Examine trends

```{r}
mw1 = official %>% 
  ## select date and tavg; no other variables needed
  select(date, tavg) %>% 
  ## drop any rows with missing data (this is why we did select() first)
  drop_na() %>% 
  ## use the lubridate function year() to extract the year from the date
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  ## group by year
  group_by(year) %>% 
  ## calculate the average temperature by each year
  summarize(tavg = mean(tavg))

mw1
```

- Now, plot the data

```{r}
ggplot(mw1, aes(x = year, y = tavg)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

- The pattern we see is:
    - the average temperature increased from about 45.5 degrees Fahrenheit in 1870 up to about 46.8 degrees around 1940.
    - then, temperatures went down for about 30 years, bottoming out in 1970
    - since then, the average temperature has increased over two degrees Fahrenheit
    - the rate that the average temperature is increasing is accelerating
- We could improve the plot with better labels and a title

## Temperature by 30-year period

- Meteorologists often determine weather norms by averaging over a 30-year period.
- Let's find the means of the maximum, average, and minimum temperatures by period and month.
    - We will ignore the years 1869 and 1870 to create five 30-year periods.
    - The first period is 1871 - 1900, the second 1901 - 1930, and so on.
    
```{r}
## add year and period variables to the official data set
## Note that the formula floor( (year - 1841)/30 )*30 + 1841 maps:
##    the years from 1841 to 1870 to 1841;
##    the years from 1871 to 1900 to 1871; and so on
## This value plus 29 is the end of the period
## Use str_c() from stringr to combine the different strings into the period value
##   1841 - 1870, 1871 - 1900, 1901 - 1930, 1931 - 1960, 1961 - 1990, 1991 - 2020
official = official %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date, label = TRUE),
         period1 = floor( (year - 1841)/30 )*30 + 1841,
         period = str_c(period1, "-", period1 + 29))

## Now group by period and month and calculate the averages
mw2 = official %>% 
  filter(year > 1870) %>% 
  select(date, year, month, period, tmin, tavg, tmax) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(period, month) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), tmin = mean(tmin), tavg = mean(tavg), tmax = mean(tmax))
```

- Plot the data
    - Use different facets by month
    - Line plots
    - Line color associated with min / avg / max
    
```{r}
g = ggplot(mw2, aes(x = period)) +
  # group -> to connect each point, if it is geom_point then do not have to do it
  # group can be whatever, used for giving different properties like color or shape
  geom_line(aes(y = tmin, group = 1), color = "blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y = tavg, group = 1), color = "purple") +
  geom_line(aes(y = tmax, group = 1), color = "red") +  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Temperature (Fahrenheit)") +
  ggtitle("Madison Mean Temperature by Month",
          subtitle = "Red = maximum, Purple = average, Red = low") +
  # bw
  theme( axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ month)

g
```

- If we use different scales for each month, it will be easier to see trends within the months
    
```{r}
g + 
  # overwrite
  facet_wrap( ~ month, scales = "free")
```

- There are differences among months in changes in average temperatures over time
- The largest increases in maximum temperature have occured in the colder months, November through March.
- Many months saw a decrease in mean low temperature, with some trending higher in the past thirty years

# Lecture: Daily Temperature Records

- Find the daily maximum and minimum temperatures for each day of the year in different data frames
- Record the year and the temperature for each record
- If there are ties, have a separate row for each year
- So, the resulting tables may have more than 366 rows.
- The command `slice_max()` will do what we want, finding the top values including ties.

## Temperature records

- Begin by re-reading in the official weather data
- Add year, month, and day variables
- Select the maximum temperature and time variables

```{r}
## re-read in the data
official = read_csv("../../data/madison-weather-official-2020.csv",
                    col_types = cols( name = col_character(),
                                      date = col_date(format = ""),
                                      prcp = col_double(),
                                      snow = col_double(),
                                      snow_depth = col_double(),
                                      tmin = col_double(),
                                      tmax = col_double(),
                                      tavg = col_double()))
```

- Add the time variables

```{r}
official = official %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date, label=TRUE), day = day(date))
```

- Calculations for record high and low maximum and minimum daily temperatures

```{r}
daily_tmax_high = official %>% 
  select(date, year, month, day, tmax) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  slice_max(tmax, n=1) %>% 
  ungroup()

daily_tmax_low = official %>% 
  select(date, year, month, day, tmax) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  slice_min(tmax, n=1) %>% 
  ungroup()

daily_tmin_high = official %>% 
  select(date, year, month, day, tmin) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  slice_max(tmin, n=1) %>% 
  ungroup()

daily_tmin_low = official %>% 
  select(date, year, month, day, tmin) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(month, day) %>%
  slice_min(tmin, n=1) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

## Questions

> On what date did Madison have the highest recorded temperature? What was the this temperature and how many different times was it achieved?

```{r}
daily_tmax_high %>% 
  slice_max(tmax, n=1)
```

- On July 14, 1936, Madison had an all-time high temperature of 107.
- This is the only date with a high temperature this high

> Which dates have the most ties for the highest temperature?

```{r}
daily_tmax_high %>% 
  count(month, day) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  slice_max(n)

daily_tmax_high %>% 
  filter(month == "May", day == 17)
```

- The May 17 record high of 86 degrees has been achieved five times: 1906, 1962, 1971, 1987, and 2001.

> What is the record latest date in the spring where the daily minimum temperature was below 32 degrees Fahrenheit? In which years did this occur?

```{r}
daily_tmin_low %>% 
  filter(month < "Jul", tmin < 32) %>% 
  arrange(desc(month), desc(day)) %>% 
  head()
```

- On June 10, 1972, the low temperature in Madison was 31 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the latest spring frost recorded.
