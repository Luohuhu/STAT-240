  airport = readHTMLTable(x)$`NULL` %>%

## Read the Data

```{r read-data}
## read the individual data sets
den = read_airport("../../data/DEN-2018.html")
jfk = read_airport("../../data/JFK-2018.html")
lax = read_airport("../../data/LAX-2018.html")
msp = read_airport("../../data/MSP-2018.html")
ord = read_airport("../../data/ORD-2018.html")
sfo = read_airport("../../data/SFO-2018.html")

## combine into one data set
awt = bind_rows(den, jfk, lax, msp, ord, sfo)

## remove the individual ones
rm(den, jfk, lax, msp, ord, sfo)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Any missing data?

- In the next chunk, we create a function that counts the number of missing values in a vector
- We then use `across()` inside of `summarize()` to count the missing data in each variable.

```{r missing-data}
count_na = function(x)
{
  return ( sum(is.na(x) ) )
}

awt %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), count_na)) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

# There are no missing values for any variables.
```

### Lambda functions

- `across()` also allows one to define a function within the call rather than creating and naming it beforehand
- one way to do so is using a concept from other computer programming languages called a *lambda function*
    - a lambda function is a small "anonymous" function, meaning it is not named
    - it also can only have a single input
    - the lambda function is defined, used once, and discarded
- In `across()` the syntax for specifying a lambda function is to start with the tilde (`~`) and then follow with the function definition
    - `.x` is the single input argument, and stands for here as the values in a single column
- See the example below.

```{r}
awt %>% 
  summarize(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.x)))) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
```

### Summarize Key Variables

> How many passengers and flights are there at each airport/terminal combination?

```{r key-variables-airport-passengers-flights}
## airports and terminals
awt %>%
  group_by(airport,terminal) %>%
  summarize(passengers = sum(all_total),
            flights = sum(all_flights))

### JFK and LAX have five different international terminals
### The other airports have one or two each.
```

> How many days of data are there for each airport?

```{r key-variables-airport-dates}
## examine date by airport
awt %>%
  select(airport,date) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  count(airport)
## One date is missing for all the airports
```

- One day is missing for each airport!  Can we figure out which one it is?
- One approach could be to narrow down by:
    - adding a month variable
    - counting the number of distinct days within each month
    - seeing which total is less than the actual number of days
    - find the distinct days within that month
- But a more straightforward way as we did with the Madison weather data is to:
    - create a mini data frame with all possible dates
    - join with a data summary of the dates and terminals in the data set
    - see what is missing
    
```{r}
## Create a mini temporary data set with all dates in 2018
temp = tibble(
  date = seq(ymd("2018-01-01"), ymd("2018-12-31"), 1)
)

## Find distinct dates by airport, then do a full merge and filter those with missing terminals
awt %>% 
  select(airport, date) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  full_join(temp) %>% 
  filter(is.na(airport))
## there is not airport name in temp
```

- This means May 8, 2018 is not present for at least one airport
- Earlier, we saw each airport was missing one date
    - So they are all missing May 8, 2018
- Verify by filtering for this date.  

```{r}
## check on May 8
awt %>%
  filter(date == "2018-05-08") %>%
  count()

### No airports have any data on May 8, 2018.
```

> Does the `all_total` variable match the sum of the other columns of passenger counts?

```{r key-variables-all_total}
## check that all_total column matches
awt = awt %>%
  mutate(check_total = all_n_0_15 +
            all_n_16_30 +
            all_n_31_45 +
            all_n_46_60 +
            all_n_61_90 +
            all_n_91_120 +
            all_n_120_plus +
            all_excluded)
## simply add all the column

awt %>%
  summarize(diff = sum(all_total != check_total))

table_mismatch = awt %>%
  filter(all_total != check_total)
table_mismatch
```

- There are 44 rows where the totals do not match

>  What time of day are these mismatches happening?

```{r key-variables-all_total-times}
table_mismatch %>%
  count(airport, hour)
### All mismatches are between midnight and 1am.
### Most are at LAX and JFK
```

>  Let's look at the distribution of the mismatches.

```{r key-variables-all_total-mismatch-graphic}
ggplot(table_mismatch, aes(x=all_total - check_total)) +
  geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth=5, fill = "red", color = "black")
```

- In each of the 44 cases where there is a mismatch, the `all_total` variable exceeds the `check_total`
- Most of the differences are fewer than five passengers
- The most is somewhere between 30 and 35

#### Let's consider another way to check the totals (`all_total`) using `purrr::pmap_dbl()`.

- Our method to sum across columns required naming each column
- This was not too bad with the eight we did, but could get tedious with more
- The **tidyverse** package **purrr** has a number of useful functions for iteration
    - Here, we want to iterate across columns to get a (partial) row sum
- The function `pmap_dbl()` will apply some function row-wise and return a numeric valued column of data
- The first argument to `pmap_dbl()` is a data frame
- As we are not piping into `pmap_dbl()` but instead call it within `mutate()`, we use the symbol `.` to refer to the data frame that was piped into `mutate()`.

```{r add-variables}
## check total in a new way using purrr::pmap_dbl()
## pmap_dbl here takes a data frame as its first argument
##   and then applies the function row-wise to its elements, we will use the `sum()` function
## select() supplies the data frame 
## because we do not pipe into select here directly (we're inside of a pipe into mutate),
##   we need to specify the input to select (we need to note which variables we want to sum over)
##   The '.' represents the object that was piped into mutate()
##   To this we select the columns that contain "_n_" and 'all_excluded'
## the row sums of this selected sub-data frame are saved as a new
##   variable named check_total2
awt = awt %>% 
  mutate(check_total2 =
           pmap_dbl(select(., contains("_n_"), all_excluded), sum))
## fancy way to apply same function above

## Verify that the check sums match each other
awt %>%
  select(check_total, check_total2) %>% # two variables totaling the passenger counts
  mutate(diff = check_total - check_total2) %>% # take the difference
  summarize(min = min(diff),
            max = max(diff),
            ndiff = sum(diff != 0))
## Note that there are no differences
```

- Discrepancies should not have much influence over primary questions of interest.

#### Summary of findings

- The data do not contain any observations on May 8, 2018.

- The `all_total` variable has a few discrepancies where counts differ occasionally when a flight arrival was near midnight.
- We can use `check_total` as the actual value, but this assumes the individual column counts are correct.
- Some correction or ignoring the issue is not likely to make much difference in major questions.

### Associations

- Next we'll create some graphics to see if we notice any interesting patterns that may lead to some questions we can try to address with the data.

```{r associations}
## Compare maximum wait time with average wait time
## For US Citizens
## There are many points, so use a small alpha value to lessen overplotting
ggplot(awt, aes(x=us_avg_wait, y=us_max_wait, color=airport)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1) +
  facet_wrap(~airport)

## And for non US Citizens
ggplot(awt, aes(x=non_us_avg_wait, y=non_us_max_wait, color=airport)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.05) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1) +
  facet_wrap(~airport)

## Compare average wait between US and non US citizens
ggplot(awt, aes(x=us_avg_wait, y=non_us_avg_wait, color=airport)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1) +
  facet_wrap(~airport)

## It looks like there are some times where there were few or no non-US international travelers
awt %>%
  filter(non_us_avg_wait == 0)
```
